# MotionBlur-detection-by-using-CNN

This project is based on research [started by HAL](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01250478/document) on learning a convolutional neural network for non-uniform motion blur removal. 

This is the folder that constain codes to run my cnn model.

Data are available through google drive link here:[data.zip](https://drive.google.com/a/bu.edu/file/d/0B8GhS4dXq_m2UTE5NG9sUVlLZkE/view?usp=sharing)  

In order to successfully running the code, please first unzip the "data.zip" file and put those folders "s_cnn","s_oridata","tarimg" and "transimg" into the same folder with the other python codes.

After unzipping the data and put them into proper place, you are ready to run the code.To run the cnn model, just enter "cnn.py" and run the code. It might take couple hours to run it if you are using personal computers. Usinga server or GPU to run this code would significantly lower the running time.

The trained model I generated throughout the code is shared here(since github doesn't allow file bigger than 25MB):

Thank you so much!
